Partners: Tim Fell, Dan Hutchinson

** Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship: **

What are your learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project? To learn all the things real good. Testing skills with new tools (rake-files, simplecov). Improved skills working with data-types/sets (strings, integers, arrays). Reinforcing git/github workflow.

What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches? A bit of both. Paired for project setup, troubleshooting and reviewing. Divide-and-conquer where appropriate.

How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others? Slack primary method of communication. Text or email for urgency or if no response on slack. We can send eachother messages whenever, but with might-not-get-a-response times.

How would you describe your work style? We both tend to divide work into chunks and structure our worktime based more on work-chunks than timmes of starting or stopping. In other words, we both like to reach a natural break in the workflow where a commit makes sense before walking away for the day or for a while.

What are your strengths? How can our strengths complement each other? Dan - my strenghts are mainly strategic/analytical. I think I am fairly easy to work with because one of my strengths is finding or seeing the unique talents of others, so hopefully I will be easy for Tim to work with. Tim - My strengths are Learner, Restorative, Deliberative, Arranger, and Responsibility. We have similar strengths so to stay on track I think we will have to be mindful about getting stuck in the planning phase and deliberately focus on doing things once we have a reasonable plan we agree upon.

Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects? Tim needs to feel safe enough to be able to reach out for help whenever he gets stuck otherwise he will schmuck out on the project.

How will we set direction and make decisions as a team? Have a morning meeting (around 830) to plan the day. Decide what we need to review and work on together and what we can do individually. Also decide on times and places to work together when required.

How will we overcome obstacles? Tim and I have worked together several times at this point and have good communication and rapport so I am confident we can work through any obstacles together through forthright communication and openness. For coding difficulties we will start by seeking eachother's assistance and if that does not resolve the issue we can reach out to mentors/classmates/instructors individually after discussing things.

What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work? I need space and quiet to do my best work. space to work on my own and the ability to get feedback in reasonable time. I will be available at most hours for the latter with respect to my partner. We both prefer out-loud or verbal problem-solving when we encounter difficulties in the coding aspects, so being able to talk through these issues in real-time is critical for us both.

What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences? Dan - My schedule revolves around Turing School right now so if I am awake I am generally available. Tim - I play D&D on friday nights and on sunday nights but those are really my only restraints aside from the class schedule. I don't like doing things early on weekends.

What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback? Tim - I like to ask questions about what somone is trying to do with their code before giving feedback on it. Dan - I think I am more or less the same in this respect. If I am giving feedback I like to have the code in front of both of us, probably, but am fine with both remote and in-person reviewing and feedback. If feedback is delivered politely/kindly we will both do great.

What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills? Dan - I think my biggest strength is in the strategic planning phases of the project and reasoning through what needs to happen and where. My limited background in symbolic logic also makes conditional-writing easier and more enjoyable for me. Tim - Tim is usually able to write logic to accomplish most tasks but enjoys learning new built-in methods and reading the Ruby docs to learn how to do tasks (in code) better/faster/etc. We are alike in this respect, that each such approach we are able to learn now is an additional tool to have at our disposal in the future. 

What tools do you want to use to manage the project? git, github
  For this project we will be using git, github, simplecov, and minitest.

How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
We already decided that we will ask one another for assistance first, if neither of us is able to make a breakthrough, we will, as a project unit, ask another project team to take a look before approaching mentors or instructors for the same. 

How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
Comprehensive test-writing and TDD will be critical to defining and assessing the relative success of this project. 

How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them? - Commits! When we see pushes/merge-requests from one another, the other person will review the code, and then we will be familiar with it and able to celebrate the successful merge of working code back into our master branch!
